### Matching Routes

Routes can also be restricted to a domain or subdomain. Just define a host pattern to be matched. They can also have variables:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
// Only matches if domain is "www.example.com".
r.Host("www.example.com")
// Matches a dynamic subdomain.
r.Host("{subdomain:[a-z]+}.example.com")
```

There are several other matchers that can be added. To match path prefixes:

```go
r.PathPrefix("/products/")
```

...or HTTP methods:

```go
r.Methods("GET", "POST")
```

...or URL schemes:

```go
r.Schemes("https")
```

...or header values:

```go
r.Headers("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest")
```

...or query values:

```go
r.Queries("key", "value")
```

...or to use a custom matcher function:

```go
r.MatcherFunc(func(r *http.Request, rm *RouteMatch) bool {
    return r.ProtoMajor == 0
})
```

...and finally, it is possible to combine several matchers in a single route:

```go
r.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler).
  Host("www.example.com").
  Methods("GET").
  Schemes("http")
```

Routes are tested in the order they were added to the router. If two routes match, the first one wins:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.HandleFunc("/specific", specificHandler)
r.PathPrefix("/").Handler(catchAllHandler)
```

Setting the same matching conditions again and again can be boring, so we have a way to group several routes that share the same requirements. We call it "subrouting".

For example, let's say we have several URLs that should only match when the host is `www.example.com`. Create a route for that host and get a "subrouter" from it:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.Host("www.example.com").Subrouter()
```

Then register routes in the subrouter:

```go
s.HandleFunc("/products/", ProductsHandler)
s.HandleFunc("/products/{key}", ProductHandler)
s.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler)
```

The three URL paths we registered above will only be tested if the domain is `www.example.com`, because the subrouter is tested first. This is not only convenient, but also optimizes request matching. You can create subrouters combining any attribute matchers accepted by a route.

Subrouters can be used to create domain or path "namespaces": you define subrouters in a central place and then parts of the app can register its paths relatively to a given subrouter.

There's one more thing about subroutes. When a subrouter has a path prefix, the inner routes use it as base for their paths:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.PathPrefix("/products").Subrouter()
// "/products/"
s.HandleFunc("/", ProductsHandler)
// "/products/{key}/"
s.HandleFunc("/{key}/", ProductHandler)
// "/products/{key}/details"
s.HandleFunc("/{key}/details", ProductDetailsHandler)
```
