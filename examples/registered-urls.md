### Registered URLs

Now let's see how to build registered URLs.

Routes can be named. All routes that define a name can have their URLs built, or "reversed". We define a name calling `Name()` on a route. For example:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler).
  Name("article")
```

To build a URL, get the route and call the `URL()` method, passing a sequence of key/value pairs for the route variables. For the previous route, we would do:

```go
url, err := r.Get("article").URL("category", "technology", "id", "42")
```

...and the result will be a `url.URL` with the following path:

```
"/articles/technology/42"
```

This also works for host and query value variables:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.Host("{subdomain}.example.com").
  Path("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}").
  Queries("filter", "{filter}").
  HandlerFunc(ArticleHandler).
  Name("article")

// url.String() will be "http://news.example.com/articles/technology/42?filter=gorilla"
url, err := r.Get("article").URL("subdomain", "news",
                                 "category", "technology",
                                 "id", "42",
                                 "filter", "gorilla")
```

All variables defined in the route are required, and their values must conform to the corresponding patterns. These requirements guarantee that a generated URL will always match a registered route -- the only exception is for explicitly defined "build-only" routes which never match.

Regex support also exists for matching Headers within a route. For example, we could do:

```go
r.HeadersRegexp("Content-Type", "application/(text|json)")
```

...and the route will match both requests with a Content-Type of `application/json` as well as `application/text`

There's also a way to build only the URL host or path for a route: use the methods `URLHost()` or `URLPath()` instead. For the previous route, we would do:

```go
// "http://news.example.com/"
host, err := r.Get("article").URLHost("subdomain", "news")

// "/articles/technology/42"
path, err := r.Get("article").URLPath("category", "technology", "id", "42")
```

And if you use subrouters, host and path defined separately can be built as well:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.Host("{subdomain}.example.com").Subrouter()
s.Path("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}").
  HandlerFunc(ArticleHandler).
  Name("article")

// "http://news.example.com/articles/technology/42"
url, err := r.Get("article").URL("subdomain", "news",
                                 "category", "technology",
                                 "id", "42")
```
